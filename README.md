## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Hello Everyone! Glad to see u here, In this project I learned how to apply Css Grid though I will hardly appreciate any suggestion about the use of it, also, in this project I didn't use the mobile first approach cause I wanted to experiment with a normal design I would say that it is okay, I am proud of what I did I am more than anxious for the new challenges to build! see ya until the next...
